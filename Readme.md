# SCALED

Scaled is a off-chain micro-transactions framework that aims to allow for cheap & fast micro-transactions on top Ethereum L2.

## How Scaled works?

Current implementation of Scaled combines time locked commitments, BLS signatures, and cheap execution of L2s to achieve its aim.

For latest implementation details please refer to following [document](https://hackmd.io/PzEMg9btSriAVy2--psmIw).

An alternative to BLS version is using SMT (to maintain Account tree that stores user accounts) and fraud proofs to settle time-locked commitments on-chain. You can read details [here](https://hackmd.io/d38J9USRTmO0gVBmxKBbhw). Using BLS is preferred over SMT + fraud proofs because of simplicity & better suitability for L2s.

Scaled started as a necessary component for [DSE](https://github.com/Janmajayamall/dse). It aims to be usable as a plugin payment layer by DSE as well as other such applications ~ incentivised p2p CDNs, file transfer, etc.

Typescript package for interacting with Scaled contracts is available [here](https://github.com/Janmajayamall/scaled-ts)

## Results

Table below shows approximate (not the worst case) cost of calling `post()` fn in `StateBLS` contract to settle `no. of receipts`.

L1 Gas cost = 29 Gwei
L2 Gas cost = 0.001 Gwei
ETH to Usd: 3000

| No. of receipts | L1 Gas Units | L2 Gas units | Total Cost in Wei | Total Cost in USD |
| --------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| 10              | 7804         | 1867851      | 282987974076568   | 0.85              |
| 50              | 19324        | 8811425      | 704911534986110   | 2.12              |
| 100             | 33704        | 17562568     | 1231667210256876  | 3.7               |
